## 👌 Acknowledgments
- Built with React state management to manage tab selections and display the corresponding apps dynamically.
- Utilizes component-based architecture to separate concerns for each section of the app (AppStore, AppItem, TabItem).
- Inspired by the React component lifecycle and dynamic UI updates through state changes.
